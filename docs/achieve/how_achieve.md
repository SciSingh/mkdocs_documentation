# How to achieve **ACHIEVE**‚ùì

ACHIEVE is a vision, and it will remain a goal if no appropriate plan is in place to realize it. Thus, the question is, how can we achieve ACHIEVE?

We have chosen to implement the vision in the following three methods.

- The 50/50 approach

    - Single Training Centre.
    - Survey 50 nearby villages.
    - 50% Churches planted in red and yellow villages.

- Target Area (Model Boundary) approach

    - Multi Training Centre working together.
    - Target specific boundary (area) to saturate.
    - Churches planted and maps updated until saturation.

- Kingdom Collaboration

    - Partner with other church planting organisations through COTW.
    - Collaborate on survey efforts
    - Identify & Target red/yellow areas to saturate
